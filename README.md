# MouseNow
MouseNow is a application that will display the curent coordinate of the cursor including the RGB of the pixel.

This application is developed using python 3.7.2 and Qt5 library.
This program is created to ease my process of developing other pyAutoGui projects.
Copy the "dist" folder to use the application.
